# RB3206-ELKS

ELKS aka **ESP Learning Kit Starter** is a development board for the ESP32-S3 microcontroller.
It's an educational tool for teaching electronics and embedded programming.
We employ it ourselves in courses for beginners and advanced students.

It can be powered by a USB cable or power bank coupled directly with the board.
This way you can take your ELKS with you anywhere and use it for your on-the-go projects.
